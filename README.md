# git-lazy

A focused git commit wrapper with semantic commit patterns and automated message generation.

## Would you lazy me the message of the commit? You're still the best!

Streamline your git commits with semantic patterns and intelligent auto-generated messages based on your code changes.

```bash
# Basic semantic commit

# Get suggestions (coming soon)  
git-lazy commit --suggest
```
